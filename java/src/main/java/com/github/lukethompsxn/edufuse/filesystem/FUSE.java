 * Fuse file system.
 * All documentation from "fuse.h"

 * @author Sergey Tselovalnikov
 * <p>
 * Most of these should work very similarly to the well known UNIX
 * file system operations.  A major exception is that instead of
 * returning an error in 'errno', the operation should return the
 * negated error value (-errno) directly.
 * <p>
 * All methods are optional, but some are essential for a useful
 * filesystem (e.g. getattr).  Open, flush, release, fsync, opendir,
 * releasedir, fsyncdir, access, create, ftruncate, fgetattr, lock,
 * init and destroy are special purpose methods, without which a full
 * featured filesystem can still be implemented.
 * <p>
 * See http://fuse.sourceforge.net/wiki/ for more information.
